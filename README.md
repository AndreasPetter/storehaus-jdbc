# storehaus-jdbc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AndreasPetter/storehaus-jdbc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AndreasPetter/storehaus-jdbc)

A Storehaus (http://twitter/storehaus) implementation that supports all kinds of JDBC databases, based on ScalikeJDBC, see http://scalikejdbc.org/

Supports all databases that are supported by ScalikeJDBC. That is, according to the ScalikeJDBC website, cite:
"PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2 Database Engine, HSQLDB. We believe that ScalikeJDBC basically works with any other RDBMS (Oracle, SQL Server and so on)."
However, for Storehaus-JDBC this still has to be tested further.

This layer can be used with any kind of project that allows to use Storehaus stores, espc. Scray.
